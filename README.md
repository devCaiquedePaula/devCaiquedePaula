# Welcome to My Coding Universe! üöÄ

## About Me

üìä As a Software Engineer specialized in Back-End, with approximately 3 years of experience, I work with established technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, relational and non-relational DBMS (like MongoDB), and Docker.
I stand out for creating innovative solutions, such as a robust authentication microservice that optimized inter-module communication and enhanced the security and efficiency of operations. Using technologies like Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, MongoDB, and Docker, this project achieved a 30% reduction in response time and a 25% increase in transaction reliability. In parallel, I am currently deepening my expertise in C#, studying this technology to further expand my skills in developing innovative solutions.

Additionally, I participated in the development of a content management platform that integrated real-time data processing services. By applying tools such as Apache Kafka for data streaming, Spark for processing large volumes of information, and Node.js for creating dynamic APIs, the system enabled highly accurate predictive analytics, reducing the time for strategic decision-making by 40%.

üîé My journey is marked by a passion for technology and an incessant desire to evolve and seek new knowledge.
I am currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development, which has broadened my perspective and expertise in the technology field. Complementing this education, I completed specializations at Harvard University and the University of Helsinki, where I deepened my understanding of agile methodologies, software design, and system architecture.

üìñ I believe in the power of collaboration and effective communication as fundamental pillars for innovation.
I work seamlessly within multidisciplinary teams, always focused on uniting efforts to create solutions that not only address technical demands but also drive digital transformation and enhance business competitiveness.

üí° Committed to continuous learning, I stay current through courses, workshops, and conferences.
My goal is to grow constantly, embracing challenges that drive innovation and allow me to apply creative solutions in software development. I strive to enhance my skills and contribute to impactful digital experiences.
